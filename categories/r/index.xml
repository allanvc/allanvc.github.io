      <description>Everyone who is addicted to R dreams about making his/her first package. An even bigger dream is to make your package available on CRAN - The Comprehensive R Archive Network.
That being said, I am proud to announce my first R package: emstreeR. It is available on CRAN since the beginning of December 2018.
emstreeR is a package for fast and easily computing Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees.</description>

      <description>This is an example of how to scrape Google News with the awesome rvest package.
This work is the result of a question that came up on the WhatsApp group of our site blackbeltR. A user came up with this problem and I decided to help him. It was a cool challenge, so why not?
A great deal of the basic ideas comes from his own code. I just kept it and added few things in order to get the code working.</description>
