      <description>I am proud to announce emstreeR - my first R package that is available on CRAN since the beginning of December 2018.
‘emstreeR’ is a package for fast and easily computing Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees (EMST). It heavily relies on RcppMLPACK and Rcpp to work as wrapper to the EMST Dual-Tree Boruvka algorithm available in ‘mlpack’ - the C++ Machine Learning library. ‘emstreeR’ allow R users to benefit from the EMST C++ function without having to deal with the R/Rcpp/C++ integration.</description>

      <description>This is an example of how to scrape Google News with the awesome rvest package.
This work is the result of a question that came up on the WhatsApp group of our site blackbeltR. A user came up with this problem and I decided to help him. It was a cool challenge, so why not?
A great deal of the basic ideas comes from his own code. I just kept it and added few things in order to get the code working.</description>
