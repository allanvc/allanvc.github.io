&lt;h1 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FisFa (or Fiscaliza Fatura) is a software developed in &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; and a little bit in Python. Its aim is to automate contract management tasks in Fies - the Brazilian Higher Education Fund. Previously to FisFa, contract invoices from banks used to take more than two weeks to be analyzed. After FisFa, the time has drop to roughly 1 minute. The quality of the analysis also has increadibly improved. After the analysis, FisFa provides the user with several reports about the invoice and also indicates possible errors in data. The whole process became highly robust, which is extremely desirable since the monthly values of the invoices usually are beyond US$5 million. Due to monthly errors found by FisFa in invoices, the Brazilian Government saved more than US$50 million since 2016 until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;awards&#34;&gt;Awards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recognition for the incredible results aforementioned, FisFa received two awards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standout Project in Contract Management&lt;/strong&gt;. 4th ANGC Aeards - Best Initiatives Of The Year on Contract Mangement, Sep. 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Place Strengthening Internal Controls in the Public Administration&lt;/strong&gt;. CGU&amp;rsquo;s 4th Good Practices Award, Dec. 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;technical-details&#34;&gt;Technical details&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FisFa is mainly programmed in R. It is divided in specific functions for each contract and a main function to manage these other functions. One of the great things (in my opinion) about FisFa is the fact that its GUI is made with &lt;code&gt;gtk+ 2&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;, which is possible because of the great package &lt;code&gt;RGtk2&lt;/code&gt;. It runs like a Windowns application. We use &lt;code&gt;Rscript&lt;/code&gt; to do this. We choose an extension to the GUI file and tell Windows to run it always with &amp;ldquo;RScript.exe&amp;rdquo;. So, it basically runs as an executable file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python part was used only to hide the functions from users, which are not versed in R, so they are not able to commit any critical change to the core files by mistake. The communication between the &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; code and Python code is made using &lt;code&gt;Rserve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;svScokets&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; side and &lt;code&gt;pyRserve&lt;/code&gt; on the Python side. The functions are kept in the cloud and the Python code gets them in the beginning of each session and load them into the &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; Global Environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;license&#34;&gt;License&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FisFa is registered under the Brazilian Patent &lt;strong&gt;BR 51 2016 000212 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
