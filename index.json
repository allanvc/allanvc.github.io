A user in the group came up with this problem and I decided to help him. It was a cool challenge, so why not?\nI should advice you that a great deal of the basic ideas comes from his own code. I just kept it and added few things in order to get the code working. First off, you should take a look at the Google News (or Google Notícias) website HERE which I reproduce below:\n You may notice, on the right side of the page, that we are using the Google Chrome dev-tools. We use this to identify the html nodes we will need. You can access this tool by hitting the F12 key. The html nodes are passed as arguments to the rvest functions.\nBasically, the idea is to extract the communication vehicle (vehicle), the time elapsed since the news was published (time), and the main headline (headline).\nThe code and coments are presented below:\n# loading the packages: library(dplyr) # we want the pipes library(rvest) # webscrapping library(stringr) # to deal with strings and to clean up our data # extracting the whole website google \u0026lt;- read_html(\u0026quot;https://news.google.com/?hl=pt-BR\u0026amp;gl=BR\u0026amp;ceid=BR:pt-419\u0026quot;) # extracting the com vehicles # we pass the nodes in html_nodes and extract the text from the last one # we use stringr to delete strings that do not matter vehicle_all \u0026lt;- google %\u0026gt;% html_nodes(\u0026quot;div div div main c-wiz div div div article div div div\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% html_text() %\u0026gt;% str_subset(\u0026quot;[^more_vert]\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_subset(\u0026quot;[^share]\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_subset(\u0026quot;[^bookmark_border]\u0026quot;) vehicle_all[1:10] # take a look at the first ten ## [1] \u0026quot;G1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;UOL\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;Terra\u0026quot; \u0026quot;G1\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;Brasil 247\u0026quot; \u0026quot;G1\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;Folha de S.Paulo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Terra\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;Diário do Centro do Mundo\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Esmael Morais\u0026quot; # extracting the time elapsed time_all \u0026lt;- google %\u0026gt;% html_nodes(\u0026quot;div article div div time\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% html_text() time_all[1:10] # take a look at the first ten ## [1] \u0026quot;4 horas atrás\u0026quot; \u0026quot;hoje\u0026quot; \u0026quot;hoje\u0026quot; \u0026quot;hoje\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;hoje\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5 horas atrás\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5 horas atrás\u0026quot; \u0026quot;4 horas atrás\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;uma hora atrás\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5 horas atrás\u0026quot; # extracting the headlines # and using stringr for cleaning headline_all \u0026lt;- google %\u0026gt;% html_nodes(\u0026quot;article\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% html_text(\u0026quot;span\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_split(\u0026quot;(?\u0026lt;=[a-z0-9áéó!?])(?=[A-Z])\u0026quot;) # also considering portuguese special characters headline_all \u0026lt;- sapply(headline_all, function(x) x[1]) # extract only the first elements headline_all[1:10] # take a look at the first ten ## [1] \u0026quot;Bolsonaro diz a site que depósito de ex-assessor do filho na conta da mulher foi para pagar dívida\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;Bolsonaro diz que ex-assessor tinha dívida com ele e pagou à primeira-dama\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;Movimentação atípica de ex-assessor de Flávio Bolsonaro pode levar a investigação\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;Relatório do Coaf cita ex-servidora de Jair Bolsonaro, filha de ex-motorista de Flávio Bolsonaro\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;Perguntado sobre bolsogate, Onyx ataca Coaf e abandona coletiva\u0026quot; ## [6] \u0026quot;Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Roraima; interventor será governador eleito\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;Após paralisação estadual, Temer anuncia intervenção integral em Roraima\u0026quot; ## [8] \u0026quot;Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Roraima até o fim do ano\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;Governador eleito de Roraima vai comandar intervenção militar no estado\u0026quot; ## [10] \u0026quot;Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Roraima\u0026quot; In this last case we used a regular expression (REGEX) to clean up the data. We did this by separating the actual headline phrases from the complementary ones. In some cases, we have a phrase ending with uppercase letters such as “SP” (a Brazilian state) collapsed with other phrase initiating with another uppercase letter such as “A” (a common article in Portuguese) for example. We have to think of a better way to split these cases, but the current result is quite satisfactory for now.\nBefore we finish, we have to clean up our data. It is common to collect garbage in the process such as data related to “fake news verification”“, which is a section on the right side of the page (in the Brazilian version). As a result, it is possible that the three vectors we have created may have different sizes. Therefore, we use the smallest of them as the base and just delete the entries above this number on the other two vectors.\n# finding the smallest vector min \u0026lt;- min(sapply(list(vehicle_all, time_all, headline_all), length)) # cutting vehicle_all \u0026lt;- vehicle_all[1:min] time_all \u0026lt;- time_all[1:min] headline_all \u0026lt;- headline_all[1:min] And we have our final data frame:\ndf_news \u0026lt;- data_frame(vehicle_all, time_all, headline_all) df_news ## # A tibble: 130 x 3 ## vehicle_all time_all headline_all ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 G1 4 horas at… Bolsonaro diz a site que depósito de ex… ## 2 UOL hoje Bolsonaro diz que ex-assessor tinha dív… ## 3 Terra hoje Movimentação atípica de ex-assessor de … ## 4 G1 hoje Relatório do Coaf cita ex-servidora de … ## 5 Brasil 247 hoje Perguntado sobre bolsogate, Onyx ataca … ## 6 G1 5 horas at… Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Ro… ## 7 Folha de S.Paulo 5 horas at… Após paralisação estadual, Temer anunci… ## 8 Terra 4 horas at… Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Ro… ## 9 Diário do Centro … uma hora a… Governador eleito de Roraima vai comand… ## 10 Esmael Morais 5 horas at… Temer anuncia intervenção federal em Ro… ## # ... with 120 more rows ","date":1534903994,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534903994,"objectID":"d0739718acdd3f4cdd5a070b58273e39","permalink":"/post/web-scrap/2018-08-21-google_news_scraping/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/web-scrap/2018-08-21-google_news_scraping/","section":"post","summary":"This is an example of how to scrape Google News website with the awesome rvest package.\nThis work is the result of a question that appear in the WhatsApp group of our blog R Dojo.

Its aim is to automate contract management tasks in Fies - the Brazilian Higher Education Fund. Previously to FisFa, contract invoices from banks used to take more than two weeks to be analyzed. After FisFa, the time has drop to roughly 1 minute. The quality of the analysis also has increadibly improved. After the analysis, FisFa provides the user with several reports about the invoice and also indicates possible errors in data. The whole process became highly robust, which is extremely desirable since the monthly values of the invoices usually are beyond US$5 million. Due to monthly errors found by FisFa in invoices, the Brazilian Government saved more than US$50 million since 2016 until now.\nAwards As a recognition for the incredible results aforementioned, FisFa received two awards:\n Standout Project in Contract Management. 4th ANGC Aeards - Best Initiatives Of The Year on Contract Mangement, Sep. 2018.\n 1st Place Strengthening Internal Controls in the Public Administration. CGU\u0026rsquo;s 4th Good Practices Award, Dec. 2016.\n  Technical details FisFa is mainly programmed in R. It is divided in specific functions for each contract and a main function to manage these other functions. One of the great things (in my opinion) about FisFa is the fact that its GUI is made with gtk+ 2 inside R, which is possible because of the great package RGtk2. It runs like a Windowns application. We use Rscript to do this. We choose an extension to the GUI file and tell Windows to run it always with \u0026ldquo;RScript.exe\u0026rdquo;. So, it basically runs as an executable file.\nThe Python part was used only to hide the functions from users, which are not versed in R, so they are not able to commit any critical change to the core files by mistake. The communication between the R code and Python code is made using Rserve and svScokets on the R side and pyRserve on the Python side. The functions are kept in the cloud and the Python code gets them in the beggining of each session and load them into the R Global Environment.\nLicense FisFa is registered under the Brazilian Patent BR 51 2016 000212 3.\n","date":1480557600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480557600,"objectID":"3f5be21aa5cf49e396e7bd032c346313","permalink":"/project/internal-fisfa/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-02:00","relpermalink":"/project/internal-fisfa/","section":"project","summary":"A Software for Contract Management","tags":["other"],"title":"FisFa","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461726000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461726000,"objectID":"c39d37c9f9dbb4f58316a82ae4ab6003","permalink":"/statsr/external-cat_data/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-03:00","relpermalink":"/statsr/external-cat_data/","section":"statsr","summary":"Some traditional examples of `Categorical Data Analysis` involving Logistic Regression, Multicategory Logit Models, Log-linear models, and others.","tags":["catdata","log-reg","logit","log-lin"],"title":"Categorical Data Analysis","type":"statsr"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461726000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461726000,"objectID":"eb15b11a3328623b82db0505c99a12d1","permalink":"/statsr/external-slide_tcc2/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-03:00","relpermalink":"/statsr/external-slide_tcc2/","section":"statsr","summary":"A method for finding the number k of clusters in data, which I proposed as my Final Undergraduate Project.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging.

The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location.
