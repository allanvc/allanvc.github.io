      <description>This is an example of how to scrape Google News website with the awesome rvest package.
This work is the result of a question that appear in the WhatsApp group of our blog R Dojo. A user in the group came up with this problem and I decided to help him. It was a cool challenge, so why not?
I should advice you that a great deal of the basic ideas comes from his own code.</description>
